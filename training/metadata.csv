audio_0000_nosilence_000|Did you know our national bird, the bald eagle? Its primary purpose in life is to build a better nest.
audio_0001_nosilence_000|This September, my first picture book for children, called Just Because, is going to be hitting shelves. I am personally excited about this because this is a collection of life lessons that I hope is going to empower young readers big.
audio_0001_nosilence_001|small. Hope is going to help them celebrate the poetry of human relations and interactions, mine and yours. Over it reminds them that one person's appetite just because.
audio_0002_nosilence_000|Everybody happy Friday, happy September. That's knockup on me a hair. As the days are about start getting shorter, which means you get an extra hour of darkness on a Friday night, which can be a good thing. I don't know, I kind of like it.
audio_0002_nosilence_001|It's coming early, it's kind of either earlier, you look up and start thinking, oh my gosh, is it one o'clock yet? No, just coming on midnight. Hey, this week, mattering matters. Problems question I hear.
audio_0002_nosilence_002|Man, I'm just, I don't know, feeling insignificant inadequate at work and my relationship is like everything I do. I can just miss in the mark. I'm not satisfied and I'm frustrated with my life right now. I hear people say, man, I'm grinding at work, man.
audio_0002_nosilence_003|grinding, and waiting on that promotion, but it just never comes. Well, I found an answer once in a very unexpected place. My mom's retirement community. Yeah, I don't know about all retirement.
audio_0002_nosilence_004|communities, but this one was cool. There was a bunch of old people minding to themselves, not looking for anything or anyone else to give them significance. It's like they got into older age and became revolutionaries again.
audio_0002_nosilence_005|or anarchist. I don't know. Anyway, they were like kids. These particular elders were God-loving patriotic Americans with wild senses of humor and a total lack of pre-tint or political correctness. They laughed at every...
audio_0002_nosilence_006|and loved getting laughed at. They also love to have a good chat and offer unsolicited life advice. You always look like you're having fun when I see your work, Matthew, and that's what life's about. Keep that in fun.
audio_0002_nosilence_007|or this one. Either the greatest achievement in life as kids, I'm not the usually just telling you, you have a bunch of them. And remember, grandkids or twice as nice and half the world.
audio_0002_nosilence_008|Death, family, crisis, and newborns, the end of a life, trying to keep a life, and welcoming in a new one. These are three things that will shake our floor. Give us clarity, remind us of our mortality, and give us courage to live our life.
audio_0002_nosilence_009|harder, stronger and truer. Three things that make us ask ourselves, what matters? Three things that make us realize it all does. The following is an excerpt from a...
audio_0002_nosilence_010|prayer, my new book poems and prayers. It's called mattering matters. So dear God, may what matters to me be what matters to you? And may that matter determine what I do?
audio_0002_nosilence_011|May my struggle matter more than my strive, may death matter more than this life. May forgiveness matter more than revenge. May restraint matter more than my binge. May my wants matter as much as...
audio_0002_nosilence_012|my needs, may my thoughts matter less than my deeds. May the truth matter more than the lies, may the house matter as much as the wise, may the guest matter to the host, may the
audio_0002_nosilence_013|matter to the coast. May the cheers matter to the toast. May the humor matter to the roast. May earn matter more than deserve. May the steel matter to the nerve. May space matter to town.
audio_0002_nosilence_014|May the heart matter to mind. May the risk matter to the leap. May letting go matter to keep. May the spirit matter to our voice. May options matter to our choice. May rhythm matter to...
audio_0002_nosilence_015|my muse may finding matter when I lose, may should matter to must, may love matter to lust, may righteousness matter to just, may our word matter to trust, may laws matter to the
audio_0002_nosilence_016|may borders matter to the fence, may money matter to spend, may prayer matter to the bend, may what's broken matter to mend, may the credit matter to lend, may memory matter to
audio_0002_nosilence_017|Matter to libation and may fun, matter on vacation. May help matter to the holler. May prudence matter to the collar. May science matter to prediction. May dreams matter to fiction. May ignorance matter to...
audio_0002_nosilence_018|abuse may pardon matter to the excuse may direction matter to the pace and may debate matter to the case may heaven matter to seek may patience matter to the
audio_0002_nosilence_019|How's Matter 2 I do and may the horizon matter to our view? Hearing matters, talk to you next week.
audio_0003_nosilence_000|Hey everybody, happy Friday afternoon. If I'm speaking a little lower, lower, lower on the vocal level, it's because, uh, well, it's, uh, it's thirst-eat-me.
audio_0003_nosilence_001|for me and my kids are laying down. I gotta get up early and go to Europe. But here we go. This one's called entitled The Book that Changed My Life. You know one of the most common questions I give is,
audio_0003_nosilence_002|What books shaped you, McCoy? And look, I could name a few, but the one that mattered most wasn't one that I went looking for. It was one that came looking for me.
audio_0003_nosilence_003|It was the end of myself more year in college. Final exams were looming and I was not sleeping well. Not because of my mattress, but because of my mind.
audio_0003_nosilence_004|I was having doubts about my plans to become a lawyer. The man that didn't add up, four years of undergrad, and I'd be 23. And in three more years, law school, and I'd be 26, and poorhead.
audio_0003_nosilence_005|Get out, I had to get a job, I mean, well, I wouldn't start making my mark in this world. And that was almost 30 years old. I didn't want to miss my 20s, preparing for the rest of my life. And also...
audio_0003_nosilence_006|been writing short stories in my journals. I passed a few off to my good friend Rob Benler. He was a film student in NYU who attested that they were original and worth sharing. Thought about filming.
audio_0003_nosilence_007|He asked me, you're a good storyteller. We film school, I said, wait a minute, that sounds flattering, but it also sounds foreign, almost European, radical, irresponsible, indulgent, and no...
audio_0003_nosilence_008|Oh, yeah, artsy even. I couldn't even get the idea into the dialect of my dreams, much less consider as a rational aspiration. Nass, not for me.
audio_0003_nosilence_009|A few hours before my psychology final exam, I showed up at my fraternity. I grabbed lunch and I went across the back alley to a couple of fellow adult brothers plays so I could finish studying.
audio_0003_nosilence_010|They were both sleeping in bunk beds because they pulled all nighters cramming I sat on the couch and they opened my textbook and you got to understand I was a diligent studdy I mean I would use every spare second I had
audio_0003_nosilence_011|for a test and I took great pride in being composed and ready for an exam. Mia, I made a lot of A's. But on this day, this time for some reason with the exam.
audio_0003_nosilence_012|I'm only a few hours away. I shut the textbooks. I said to myself, you got this because, I just put the textbook away. And I did. I also put my notes in my backpack.
audio_0003_nosilence_013|I was a turn on the TV. ESPN. Yeah, baby, I love sports. I'm telling you, I will watch the world's strongest man competition if that's all that's on. I'll watch cricket, bro. Today.
audio_0003_nosilence_014|There was a baseball game on, even better. But for some reason, I've been for five minutes of watching. For some reason, I shut the TV off. Wasn't interested. I looked around the room.
audio_0003_nosilence_015|floor to the left of me was his stack of magazines. Playboys, hustlers, oh yeah I like looking at naked women but for some reason not today or what dinner has to do.
audio_0003_nosilence_016|as I flipped about seven magazines deep into the pile. I suddenly came across a small paperback book that I white-covered with a handsome red curve-like title that read.
audio_0003_nosilence_017|the greatest salesman in the world. What was that? I wondered as I picked it up from the pile and began to read two and a half hours later. I got to the first...
audio_0003_nosilence_018|scrolled in the book. The book had just revealed to me that the title was referring to the reader of the book in this instance. And now my instructions were to read.
audio_0003_nosilence_019|Each scroll three times a day for 30 days before moving on to the next one Suddenly I looked at my watch My exam was in 20 minutes. Oh I packed my stuff in my backpack and I russled
audio_0003_nosilence_020|my friend from his book and I said, hey, hey, Braden, Braden, wake up, babe, can I borrow this book? Through sleepy eyes, he kind of woke up, he looked at me and said, no, man, you can have it.
audio_0003_nosilence_021|left, book in hand, and made it to my test on time. Something about this book, or the title, the story so far, the mystery of the Ten Scrolls, it just felt special, like it had found me.
audio_0003_nosilence_022|I rushed through my exam. I did not care about psychology class and I did not care what grade I made. I only cared about reading that first scroll. Somehow I knew. I knew that something bigger than a classroom exam.
audio_0003_nosilence_023|them, laid within the pages of this book. Scroll number one, I will form good habits and become their slaves. Oh, suddenly it occurred to me.
audio_0003_nosilence_024|that it was a bad habit to keep lying to myself, to keep lying to myself about becoming a lawyer that was what I was expected to be and what path I was on and hit me that was not for me.
audio_0003_nosilence_025|No, I wanted to tell stories. Yeah, that book has stayed with me ever since. One of the few I ever recommend.
audio_0003_nosilence_026|It was the first nudge that gave me permission to choose story over statute, imagination over litigation. And I've been telling stories ever since. Sometimes on film.
audio_0003_nosilence_027|sometimes in print. All because I stumbled on a paperback in a stack of magazines and didn't want to watch the baseball game. Thank you, Braden.
audio_0003_nosilence_028|Just keep living folks. Good luck in Forum, but also be open to win fine in here.
audio_0004_nosilence_000|Hey everybody happy Friday to you. Here's what I got this week man. Um... Why we all need to walk about? Yeah... Problems, questions, I hear.
audio_0004_nosilence_001|this social media work, this fast-paced world, it just doesn't seem to let me slow down. How can I find some clarity with all these distractions in my life? Or, ma, I just seem stressed all the time, man, I jump right into work in the morning
audio_0004_nosilence_002|and even my weekends seem to be full of responsibilities. Work, family, friends, jeez. Well, I'm going to tell you a story. I got extremely famous over one weekend in 1996. The film I was in at the time to kill.
audio_0004_nosilence_003|open to great box office and great reviews. All right, performance included. The Monday after that weekend, my world changed, man. I mean, suddenly, I lost any anonymity I once had. It was like the world.
audio_0004_nosilence_004|was a mirror. It seemed like everyone recognized me. It even seemed like everyone loved me. I heard that a lot. I never met strangers anymore after that weekend.
audio_0004_nosilence_005|and was like, what's this whole bout? What was reality and what was bullshit? Did I deserve all this? Who the hell was I? I needed to hear myself think. I needed to check out, to check in. So I could see.
audio_0004_nosilence_006|settle into my new position of leverage and measure what it was. I need to get less impressed with it, find some discernment and figure out what kind of role in what type of film I wanted to do next.
audio_0004_nosilence_007|I need some starvation. Then, add a wet dream. Yep, the involuntary intercourse. Hands free, inflatio free, not eternal emission of semen. One has while sleeping.
audio_0004_nosilence_008|Rare but welcome to these lucid dreams most commonly involve a theme of sexual activity. Well, the wet dream I had was not common. My wet dream was this. I was seeing myself floating downstream on my back.
audio_0004_nosilence_009|in the Amazon River. Rapped up by Anaconda's and pythons surrounded by crocodiles, peronias, and freshwater sharks. There are African tribes been lined up, shoulder to shoulder on the ridge to the left of me as far as my eye.
audio_0004_nosilence_010|I could see how's it piece 11 frames 11 seconds then I came I woke up whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what that was that man
audio_0004_nosilence_011|All the elements of a nightmare, right? But no, it was a way of dream. I mean, what was this mean? I wondered. There were two things that I was sure about the dream. One, I was on the Amazon rip.
audio_0004_nosilence_012|And two, those were African tribesmen on the left ridge. So I grabbed my world atlas and I looked for the Amazon River in the continent of Africa until I realized wrong continent it's not there.
audio_0004_nosilence_013|Damn, and dreams can be tricky. Nevertheless, it was a sign and it was just what I was looking for. It was time for me to chase down my red dream. So I cram my backpack with minimal clothing, my
audio_0004_nosilence_014|a journal camera medical kit, a head of E, and my favorite headband. Then embarked on a 22-day solo trip to Peru to find and float. Like in my wet dream, the Amazon river. I flew to Lima.
audio_0004_nosilence_015|then on Tukusko where I met a guide and we mapped out my three-week journey to the Amazon River over Antikoochos and Pisco. I hike the Andes and along the Urubamba River into the lost city of Machibitju and I took a bus.
audio_0004_nosilence_016|boat and a plane ride to get to Geethos, the Peruvian capital of the Amazon. It was the 12th night of my 22-day adventure and I was settling into camp. Now, I'd already hiked over 80...
audio_0004_nosilence_017|miles and tomorrow I'd finally be in the waters of my wet dream. And after this point in the trip I've been having a hard time being present. I'm so excited and anticipation of what the Amazon would mean to me.
audio_0004_nosilence_018|I had missed most of the beauties in getting there. Still wrestling with my identity. I was guilt-ridden over sins of my past, lonely, disgusted with the company I was keeping. Yeah, me.
audio_0004_nosilence_019|my own in my tent, grappling with my demons. I couldn't sleep, so I could try and instead I stripped off all my clothes along with every badge, banner, expectation and affiliation I had on me. I discarded my American baseball cap.
audio_0004_nosilence_020|Celtic not pendant the lo and star flag game that needed my gold ring my father had given me I Removed every idle that ever gave me comfort or confidence all the packaging around my product was disrobed I even punched myself
audio_0004_nosilence_021|the face a couple of times for good measure. Now naked and stripped down to nothing, I was only a child of God and nothing more soaked in cold sweat I've vomited until there's no biol left in my belly. Then I passed out from exhaustion.
audio_0004_nosilence_022|A few hours later, I woke on the 13th morning to a rising sun. Surprisingly, fresh and energized, I dressed, made some tea, and went for a morning walk. Not toward my destination or any expectation.
audio_0004_nosilence_023|but rather to nowhere in particular. I feel great, alive, clean, free, bright. Walking down along a muddy path, I turned a corner, and there in the middle of the trail was a mirage of the most...
audio_0004_nosilence_024|magnificent pink, blue and red colors I had ever seen. It was electric, like it was plugged in glowing, vibrant, just hovering just above the jungle floor, pulsing as if it was plugged into some neon charge power plant.
audio_0004_nosilence_025|I stopped or it stopped me and I stared, backed up a pace. There was nowhere around it and it was no mirage at all. The jungle floor in front of me was actually...
audio_0004_nosilence_026|kaleidoscope of thousands of butterflies, whose lawn sparring was spectacular. I stayed a while gaping in wonder, captivated. I heard this little voice inside.
audio_0004_nosilence_027|ahead, say these words. All I want is what I can see. No, I can see is in front of me. No longer in a rush to get anywhere or anticipating what we're doing.
audio_0004_nosilence_028|around the corner, coming up next or up ahead, time slowed down. I raised my chin to this guy and said, a quiet thank you, and glanced down the path, just past the massive monodery of levitating butterflies, and there.
audio_0004_nosilence_029|And for the first time, I saw the Amazon River, the tower of all my anxieties, now lying down laterally in front of me, just like that slow moving river. For the first time in a month.
audio_0004_nosilence_030|I was at ease. A few hours later I returned to camp to pack for my continued journey. On arrival my guide called out to me in Spanish. Soy slews, my tail, soy slews, meaning you are light.
audio_0004_nosilence_031|you're light. Yeah, now for given I'd let go of the guilt. My confusion was gone. My penets felt paid back in good graces. I shook hands with myself. From that
audio_0004_nosilence_032|morning on I was present, embracing only what I could see in front of me and giving it the justice it deserved. Why don't we need to walk about? Ah man noise to signal ratio. I mean we're...
audio_0004_nosilence_033|more constantly bombarded by unnatural stimuli than ever before. I think we need to put ourselves in places of decreased sensory input so we can hear the background signals of our psychological processes as the noise deque.
audio_0004_nosilence_034|is the signals become clearer. We can hear ourselves again. When we do that, we reunite. You know, time alone simplifies the heart. Memory catches up, opinions form.
audio_0004_nosilence_035|We meet truth again and it teaches us. Lanyl stable feet between our reaching out and retreat. Because our unconscious mind now has room to reveal itself, we see again. It dreams, perceive.
audio_0004_nosilence_036|and things and pictures which we can now observe in this solitude, we begin to think in pictures and actualize what we see. It's like our souls become mononymous again. We realize.
audio_0004_nosilence_037|that we are stuck with the one person we can never get rid of. Guess who? Our selves. The Socratic dialogue can be ugly, painful, lonesome, hard, guilt-ridden, nightmare, vicious enough to need a mouthguard, not to gnar.
audio_0004_nosilence_038|our fangs and the nubs always sweat cold and feverish panic, but we're forced to confront ourselves. And I believe this is good. We more than deserve this suffrage. We've earned it. And Honest Bands pillow is a...
audio_0004_nosilence_039|peace of mind and no matter who's in our bed each night, we sleep with ourselves. We either forgive or get sick and tired of it. And herein I believe lies the evolution. With nowhere to run,
audio_0004_nosilence_040|force to deal with ourselves. And every day, suppression's breakout of the zoo and they start mugging around. We find ourselves in the ring with them deciding no more or let it slide. Whatever the verdict is, we grow. It's us and us.
audio_0004_nosilence_041|are always in our only company. We tend to ourselves and getting good graces once again. Then we return to civilization able to better tend to our tendencies. Why? Because we took a walk about.
audio_0004_nosilence_042|I understand not everybody has a luxury to take five weeks off or three weeks off whatever was to fly to the Amazon. Am I saying do that? A walk-about can be a solo weekend with yourself. Reservations for one for dinner or a quiet...
audio_0004_nosilence_043|hour, a dawn. Whatever it looks like, give yourself the gift of disappearing and showing yourself to yourself. You can come back more fully you. Because like we said earlier,
audio_0004_nosilence_044|or the only person you're always gonna be walking with, sleeping with, and the only person you cannot ever kick out of your life. Is you? Take a walk about with this up, buddy. Have a great weekend.
audio_0005_nosilence_000|Hey everybody, what kind of hey here? The. Um, I'm about to do the audio recording from a new book called Just Because. It's a children's picture book, all of us I believe. Um, this came to me in the middle of the night and it-
audio_0005_nosilence_001|thought it was a Bob Dylan, a little scatterrap song. Just the cuzz, kind of that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, I got up and wrote it down, and when I looked back at it, I was like, hey, I think that'd be really good for us to gone and share it around.
audio_0005_nosilence_002|of other smart other kids and they were like, oh, that's what we got. It's called just because I'm gonna give an audio read now. I hope you enjoy the conversation it starts between you and your kids.
audio_0006_nosilence_000|You know, we get inspired, we get an idea, we get a plan, the truth crosses us. And when it does, we usually feel like, oh, it is so clear and makes so much sense to me. I'll never forget that.
audio_0006_nosilence_001|We will forget it. That's one of the values of writing in the journal. It's a way to put it down to document it. It's a written manifestation of what it is we're chasing.
audio_0006_nosilence_002|in ourselves where we want to go to manifestation of our future and it's documented. And again, you write it down, you can forget it. You look back, you get reminded and you go, oh yeah, that's where I'm heading. Sometimes we need that reminder. Sometimes...
audio_0006_nosilence_003|we don't need that reminder and we just look back 20 years later and go son of a bitch I pulled it off
audio_0007_nosilence_000|You know, we love to make a binary contradiction of what is selfish for me and what is selfless for others. What is selfish for us, what is selfless for others. I propose we don't make those a contradiction. I propose there's a-
audio_0007_nosilence_001|place. Well, what we do for ourselves selfishly can also be what's best for the most amount of others selflessly. I propose there's a place in the decision-making paradigm that what we do is the best for the most amount of others is also the most selfish
audio_0007_nosilence_002|us. If we think about life as an infinite game, if we think about if we have children, if we think about the next generation, doing things to invest in their future, isn't that quite a selfish act? It is for me as a father for my life.
audio_0007_nosilence_003|children. It is for us as parents. It is for us who have a long view who can tap into it up. Hey, I can relieve this place a little better than the family. It's a self less choice. It is the most selfless choice. And vice versa.
audio_0008_nosilence_000|You've had a gut feeling that maybe you were meant for more, but you weren't really sure with the next best steps, or to achieve it. Me too. So what's your more? What's your?
audio_0008_nosilence_001|your destination. And I'm not talking about just more money and more things. I'm also talking about more love, more joy, more choice, more balance, more trust. What's your more?
audio_0008_nosilence_002|
audio_0009_nosilence_000|The best I can tell is that the common denominator that is bipartisan that is that can be scaled across humanity is values. You'd be whatever color shape size you want to...
audio_0009_nosilence_001|to be, but we all need to share a common set of values. Let's be fair to each other. Let's be friendly. Let's be optimistic. Let's be respectful to ourselves, respectful to other people. Let's be accountable. It's not like cheating steel. Let's look after ourselves.
audio_0009_nosilence_002|Let's look after each other. We're all right in our own book, you know? Every like or dislike or thing we send out, or the thing we choose not to send out or share. It's being recorded.
audio_0009_nosilence_003|What book are we writing, I guess, the question? Values. Been everywhere a lot of style.
audio_0010_nosilence_000|Alright, alright, alright, alright. Yes, the first three words this young man ever said on film. Thank you. Yes, Makana, hey here, and I want to welcome you to my YouTube channel.
audio_0010_nosilence_001|Along with some approaches to life that I've found useful and hopefully it's gonna be all killer no filler With some right more chase to be more you Because I'd be my channel and click the notification bell to be notified when I put
